Conducting a vulnerability assessment with Nessus in Kali Linux involves several steps.
Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you with your project. This includes setting up Nessus, performing the scan,
and interpreting the results. Finally, you can upload your project to GitHub.

I. Setting Up Nessus on Kali Linux
Step 1: Download and Install Nessus

1. **Download Nessus**:
   - Go to the [Nessus downloads page](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/select-your-operating-system).
   - Select the appropriate version for Kali Linux.

2. **Install Nessus**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the Nessus installer is downloaded.
   - Install the package using the `dpkg` command:
     ```sh
     sudo dpkg -i <Nessus-installer-package.deb>
     ```

3. **Start Nessus**:
   - Start the Nessus service:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl start nessusd
     ```
   - Enable Nessus to start on boot:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl enable nessusd
     ```

4. **Access Nessus Web Interface**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8834`.
   - Follow the instructions to set up Nessus. You will need to create an account and enter an activation code.

II. Performing a Vulnerability Scan
Step 1: Configure a New Scan

1. **Login to Nessus**:
   - Open a web browser and go to `https://localhost:8834`.
   - Log in with the account you created during setup.

2. **Create a New Scan**:
   - Click on the “New Scan” button.
   - Choose the type of scan you want to perform (e.g., Basic Network Scan).

3. **Configure the Scan**:
   - Enter the necessary details such as the name of the scan and target IP addresses.
   - You can configure advanced settings if needed.

4. **Launch the Scan**:
   - Save the scan configuration.
   - Click on the “Launch” button to start the scan.

Step 2: Monitor and Review the Scan Results

1. **Monitor Scan Progress**:
   - You can monitor the scan progress in the “My Scans” section.

2. **Review Results**:
   - Once the scan is complete, click on the scan to view the detailed results.
   - Nessus will display vulnerabilities, categorized by their severity (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).

III. Interpreting the Results

1. **Analyze Vulnerabilities**:
   - Review each vulnerability reported by Nessus.
   - Nessus provides detailed information about each vulnerability, including a description, solution, and references.

2. **Prioritize Remediation**:
   - Focus on remediating critical and high-severity vulnerabilities first.
   - Implement the recommended solutions provided by Nessus.

IV. Documenting and Uploading to GitHub

Step 1: Document Your Findings

1. **Create a Report**:
   - Summarize the findings of your vulnerability assessment.
   - Include details such as the scope of the scan, methodology, and key vulnerabilities identified.

2. **Prepare Documentation**:
   - Create markdown files for your project documentation (e.g., `README.md`).
   - Include instructions on how to set up and use Nessus, as well as your findings and recommendations.

Step 2: Upload to GitHub

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   - Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
   - Initialize a new git repository:
     ```sh
     git init
     ```

2. **Add and Commit Your Files**:
   - Add your project files to the repository:
     ```sh
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```sh
     git commit -m "Initial commit with Nessus vulnerability assessment"
     ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Link your local repository to the GitHub repository:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
     ```
   - Push your changes to GitHub:
     ```sh
     git push -u origin master
     ```
